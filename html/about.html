    <p>Having a solid content strategy is a sure-fire way to get a competitive advantage. <br> There is so much content created blindly without purpose, and this approach doesn't set you up for success.

      Relying on “finger in the air” blog content, as an example, will not help you to create content that drives the results you need. This is one of the main reasons marketers who don't see an impact from their content marketing efforts give up and 
      
      When you are developing a solid content strategy, you want to create different types of content that catches users at the right step of the sales funnel. From creating top-of-the-funnel content to end-of-the-funnel content, you will find that certain types of content will create potential customers that you can lead through the sales funnel.
      
      In this guide, we will show you how to develop a content strategy that sets you up for success and provides you with a clear roadmap for creating and publishing content that produces measurable results.</p>
