                    The Earth is now about 1.1°C warmer than it was in the 1800s. We are not on track to meet the Paris
                     Agreement target to keep global temperature from exceeding 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels.
                    That is considered the upper limit to avoid the worst fallout from climate change.These increase in temperatures
                    has resulted to occurence of random fires across the globe.

                <p class="paragraph">
                    increases in temperatures and changes in the amount and distribution of rainfall. It has altered the rain partterns
                    making it hard for farmers to know better planting seasons hence altering supply of food.
                    Deforestation can cause a vicious cycle  because the act of deforestation drive climate change,
                     which in turn hurts the food production of
                     existing farmland and motivates farmers to cut down more trees in order to meet quotas, Thus leading to
                     more Deforestaion.

                    Adaptation to climate change safeguards people from higher temperatures, rising seas, fiercer storms, unpredictable rainfall
                   and more acidic oceans. Some people are more vulnerable to these effects, such as those living in poverty.Planting 
                   of trees may help reduce these effects.

                    Climate change is the single biggest health threat facing humanity. The impacts 
                    are already harming health through air pollution, disease, extreme weather events,
                     forced displacement, food insecurity and pressures on mental health.
                     Every year, environmental factors take the lives of around 13 million people.As we all know
                     trees are the major CO2 absorbers thus they hekp reduce the gaseous accumilation in the atmosphere.

        <h1>How to plant tress</h1>

        <div class="col-1-of-2">
            <h3 class="heading-tertiary u-margin-bottom-small">step-by-step</h3>
            <p class="par">
                
                    1. The trunk flare is where the trunk expands at the base of the tree. Ensure trunk flare is partially visible after the tree is planted. Remove excess soil prior to planting if flare is not visible. <br>
              
                    2. Dig a shallow, broad planting hole. Holes should be 2–3 times wider than the root ball, but only as deep as the root ball. <br> 
                      
                    3. If wrapped, remove any cover from around the root ball and trunk to facilitate root growth. Remove wire basket or cut one or two rings off so it is low-profile and will not interfere with future root growth.
                ect tree root ball for circling roots and straighten, cut, or remove them. Expose the trunk flare if necessary. <br>  
                      
                    4. Place the tree at the proper height. When placing the tree in the hole, lift by the root ball, not the trunk. The majority of tree’s roots develop in the top 12 inches (30 cm) of soil. Planting too deep can be harmful to the tree. <br> 
                      
                    5. Straighten the tree in the hole. Before filling the hole, have someone examine the tree from several angles to confirm it is straight. <br>  
                      
                    6. Fill the hole gently but firmly. Pack soil around the base of the root ball to stabilize it. 
                 the hole firmly to eliminate air pockets. Further reduce air pockets by watering periodically while backfilling. Avoid fertilizing at the time of planting. <br> 
                      
                    7. If staking is necessary, three stakes or underground systems provide optimum support. Studies have shown that trees develop stronger trunks and roots if they are not staked; however, it may be required when planting bare root stock or on windy sites. Remove stakes after first year of growth. <br> 
                      
                    8. Mulch the base of the tree. Place a 2–3 inch (5–7.5 cm) layer of mulch, but be sure not to pile much right against the trunk. A mulch-free area of 1–2 inches (2.5–5 cm) wide at the base of the tree will reduce moist bark and prevent decay. <br> 
                      
                     Provide follow-up care. Keep the soil moist by watering at least once a week, barring rain, and more frequently during hot, windy weather. Continue until mid-fall, tapering off as lower temperatures require less-frequent watering. <br>
